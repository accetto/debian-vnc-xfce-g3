***

This Docker Hub repository contains Docker images for headless working.

The images are based on the current [Debian 12][docker-debian] and the previous [Debian 11][docker-debian] and include [Xfce][xfce] desktop, [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and [noVNC][novnc] client.
The popular web browser [Firefox][firefox] is also included.

This [User guide][this-user-guide] describes the images and how to use them.

The related [GitHub project][this-github] contains image generators that image users generally donâ€™t need, unless they want to build the images themselves.

### Tags

The following image tags are regularly built and published on Docker Hub:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD052 -->

- `latest` (also as `12`) based on `Debian 12`
