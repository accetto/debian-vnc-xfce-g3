This Docker Hub repository contains Docker images for headless working.

The images are based on [Debian 11][docker-debian] and include [Xfce][xfce] desktop, [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and [noVNC][novnc] client.

There is also a similar sibling repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-dockerhub-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3], containing images based on [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS][docker-ubuntu].

This [User guide][this-user-guide] describes the images and how to use them.

The following image tags are regularly built and published on Docker Hub:

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD052 -->

- `latest` based on `Debian 11`

    ![badge_latest_created][badge_latest_created]
    [![badge_latest_version-sticker][badge_latest_version-sticker]][link_latest_version-sticker-verbose]

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD052 -->

**Hint:** Clicking the version sticker badge reveals more information about the particular build.

The main features and components of the images in the default configuration are:

- lightweight [Xfce][xfce] desktop environment (Debian distribution)
- [sudo][sudo] support
- current version of JSON processor [jq][jq]
- current version of high-performance [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and client
- current version of [noVNC][novnc] HTML5 clients (full and lite) (TCP port **6901**)
- popular text editor [nano][nano] (Debian distribution)
- lite but advanced graphical editor [mousepad][mousepad] (Debian distribution)
- current version of [tini][tini] as the entry-point initial process (PID 1)
- support for overriding environment variables, VNC parameters, user and group (see [User guide][this-user-guide-using-containers])
- support of **version sticker** (see [User guide][this-user-guide-version-sticker])

The following **TCP** ports are exposed by default:

- **5901** for access over **VNC** (using VNC viewer)
- **6901** for access over [noVNC][novnc] (using web browser)

This is the **third generation** (G3) of my headless images.
The **second generation** (G2) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc].
The **first generation** (G1) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce].

If you've found a problem or you just have a question, please check the [User guide][this-user-guide], [Issues][this-issues] and [sibling Wiki][sibling-wiki] first.
Please do not overlook the closed issues.

If you do not find a solution, you can file a new issue.
The better you describe the problem, the bigger the chance it'll be solved soon.

If you have a question or an idea and you don't want to open an issue, you can also use the [sibling Discussions][sibling-discussions].

**Remark:** The [GitHub project][this-github] contains image generators that image users generally donâ€™t need, unless they want to build the images themselves.
