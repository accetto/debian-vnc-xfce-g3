### Introduction

This repository contains resources for building Docker images based on [Debian 11][docker-debian] with [Xfce][xfce] desktop environment and [VNC][tigervnc]/[noVNC][novnc] servers for headless use and the current [Chromium][chromium] web browser.

There is also the sibling project [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3] containing similar images based on [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS][docker-ubuntu].

### TL;DR

#### Installing packages

I try to keep the images slim. Consequently you can encounter missing dependencies while adding more applications yourself. You can track the missing libraries on the [Debian Packages Search][debian-packages-search] page and install them subsequently.

You can also try to fix it by executing the following (the default `sudo` password is **headless**):

```shell
### apt cache needs to be updated only once
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt --fix-broken install
```

#### Shared memory size

Note that some applications require larger shared memory than the default 64MB. Using 256MB usually solves crashes or strange behavior.

You can check the current shared memory size by executing the following command inside the container:

```shell
df -h /dev/shm
```

The older sibling Wiki page [Firefox multi-process][that-wiki-firefox-multiprocess] describes several ways, how to increase the shared memory size.

#### Extending images

The provided example file `Dockerfile.extend` shows how to use the images as the base for your own images.

Your concrete `Dockerfile` may need more statements, but the concept should be clear.

The compose file `example.yml` shows how to switch to another non-root user and how to set the VNC password and resolution.

#### Building images

The fastest way to build the images:

```shell
### PWD = project root
### prepare and source the 'secrets.rc' file first (see 'example-secrets.rc')

### examples of building and publishing the individual images 
./builder.sh latest-chromium all

### just building the image, skipping the publishing and the version sticker update
./builder.sh latest-chromium build

### examples of building and publishing the images as a group
./ci-builder.sh all group latest-chromium
```

You can still execute the individual hook scripts as before (see the folder `/docker/hooks/`). However, the provided utilities `builder.sh` and `ci-builder.sh` are more convenient. Before pushing the images to the **Docker Hub** you have to prepare and source the file `secrets.rc` (see `example-secrets.rc`). The script `builder.sh` builds the individual images. The script `ci-builder.sh` can build various groups of images or all of them at once. Check the files `local-builder-readme.md`, `local-building-example.md` and the [sibling Wiki][sibling-wiki] for more information.

Note that selected features that are enabled by default can be explicitly disabled via environment variables. This allows to build even smaller images by excluding, for example, `noVNC`. See [readme-local-building-example.md][this-readme-local-building-example] for more information.

#### Sharing devices

Sharing the audio device for video with sound works only with `Chromium` and only on Linux:

```shell
docker run -it -P --rm \
  --device /dev/snd:/dev/snd:rw \
  --group-add audio \
accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest
```

Sharing the display with the host works only on Linux:

```shell
xhost +local:$(whoami)

docker run -it -P --rm \
    -e DISPLAY=${DISPLAY} \
    --device /dev/dri/card0 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
    accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest --skip-vnc

xhost -local:$(whoami)
```

Sharing the X11 socket with the host works only on Linux:

```shell
xhost +local:$(whoami)

docker run -it -P --rm \
    --device /dev/dri/card0 \
    -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw \
    accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest

xhost -local:$(whoami)
```

### Description

This is the **third generation** (G3) of my headless images. The **second generation** (G2) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc]. The **first generation** (G1) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce].

**Attention:** The [Chromium Browser][chromium] in these images runs in the `--no-sandbox` mode. You should be aware of the implications. The image is intended for testing and development.

The main features and components of the images in the default configuration are:

- utilities **ping**, **wget**, **sudo** (Debian distribution)
- current version of JSON processor [jq][jq]
- light-weight [Xfce][xfce] desktop environment (Debian distribution)
- current version of high-performance [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and client
- current version of [noVNC][novnc] HTML5 clients (full and lite) (TCP port **6901**)
- popular text editor [nano][nano] (Debian distribution)
- lite but advanced graphical editor [mousepad][mousepad] (Debian distribution)
- current version of [tini][tini] as the entry-point initial process (PID 1)
- support for overriding both the container user and the group
- support of **version sticker** (see below)
- current version of [Chromium Browser][chromium] open-source web browser (Debian distribution)

The history of notable changes is documented in the [CHANGELOG][this-changelog].

![container-screenshot][this-screenshot-container]

### Image tags

The following image tags are regularly built and published on the **Docker Hub**:

- `latest` based on `Debian 11`

Clicking on the version sticker badge in the [README on Docker Hub][this-readme-dockerhub] reveals more information about the actual configuration of the image.

### Ports

Following **TCP** ports are exposed by default:

- **5901** is used for access over **VNC**
- **6901** is used for access over [noVNC][novnc]

These default ports and also some other parameters can be overridden several ways (see bellow).

### Volumes

The containers do not create or use any external volumes by default.

Both **named volumes** and **bind mounts** can be used. More about volumes can be found in [Docker documentation][docker-doc] (e.g. [Manage data in Docker][docker-doc-managing-data]).

### Version sticker

Version sticker serves multiple purposes that are closer described in the [sibling Wiki][sibling-wiki-version-stickers]. Note that the usage of the version sticker has changed between the generations of images.

The **short version sticker value** describes the version of the image and it is persisted in its **label** during the build-time. It is also shown as its **badge** in the README file.

The **verbose version sticker value** is used by the CI builder to decide if the image needs to be refreshed. It describes the actual configuration of the essential components of the image. It can be revealed by clicking on the version sticker badge in the README file.

The version sticker values are generated by the script `version_sticker.sh`, which is deployed into the startup directory `/dockerstartup`. The script will show a short help if executed with the argument `-h`. There is also a convenient `Version Sticker` launcher on the container desktop.

## Using headless containers

There are two ways, how to use the containers created from this image.

All containers are accessible by a VNC viewer (e.g. [TigerVNC][tigervnc] or [TightVNC][tightvnc]).

The default `VNC_PORT` value is `5901`. The default `DISPLAY` value is `:1`. The default VNC password (`VNC_PW`) is `headless`.

The containers that are created from the images built with the **noVNC feature** can be also accessed over [noVNC][noVNC] by any web browser supporting HTML5.

The default `NOVNC_PORT` value is `6901`. The noVNC password is always identical to the VNC password.

There are several ways of connecting to headless containers and the possibilities also differ between the Linux and Windows environments, but usually it is done by mapping the VNC/noVNC ports exposed by the container to some free TCP ports on its host system.

For example, the following command would map the VNC/noVNC ports `5901/6901` of the container to the TCP ports `25901/26901` on the host:

```shell
docker run -p 25901:5901 -p 26901:6901 ...
```

If the container would run on the local computer, then it would be accessible over **VNC** as `localhost:25901` and over **noVNC** as `http://localhost:26901`.

If it would run on the remote server  `mynas`, then it would be accessible over **VNC** as `mynas:25901` and over **noVNC** as `http://mynas:26901`.

The image offers two [noVNC][novnc] clients - **lite client** and **full client**. Because the connection URL differs slightly in both cases, the container provides a **simple startup page**.

The startup page offers two hyperlinks for both noVNC clients:

- **noVNC Lite Client** (`http://mynas:26901/vnc_lite.html`)
- **noVNC Full Client** (`http://mynas:26901/vnc.html`)

It is also possible to provide the password through the links:

- `http://mynas:26901/vnc_lite.html?password=headless`
- `http://mynas:26901/vnc.html?password=headless`

### Overriding VNC/noVNC parameters

The VNC/noVNC parameters are controlled by related environment variables embedded into the image.

They have the following default values:

```shell
DISPLAY=:1
NOVNC_PORT=6901
VNC_COL_DEPTH=24
VNC_PORT=5901
VNC_PW=headless
VNC_RESOLUTION=1360x768
VNC_VIEW_ONLY=false
```

These environment variables can be overridden several ways.

**At image build-time** you can embed different default values by using the following build arguments:

- `ARG_VNC_PW` sets the variable `VNC_PW` (VNV/noVNC password)
- `ARG_VNC_DISPLAY` sets the variable `DISPLAY`
- `ARG_VNC_PORT` sets the variable `VNC_PORT`
- `ARG_VNC_RESOLUTION` sets the variable `VNC_RESOLUTION`
- `ARG_VNC_COL_DEPTH` sets the variable `VNC_COL_DEPTH`
- `ARG_VNC_VIEW_ONLY` set the variable `VNC_VIEW_ONLY`
- `ARG_NOVNC_PORT` sets the variable `NOVNC_PORT`

For example:

```shell
docker build --build-arg DISPLAY=:2 --build-arg ARG_VNC_PORT=6902  ...
```

**At container startup-time** you can override the environment variable values by using the `docker run -e` option. Please note that in this case you have to use the actual environment variable names, not the build argument names (e.g. `VNC_PORT` instead of `ARG_VNC_PORT`).

For example:

```shell
docker run -e VNC_PORT=6902 ...
```

**At VNC/noVNC startup-time** you can override the environment variable values by binding an external file exporting the variables to the dedicated mounting point `${HOME}/.vnc_override.rc` (a single file, not a directory).

For example, the following command would bind the file `my_own_vnc_parameters.rc` from the directory `/home/joe` to the container:

```shell
docker run -v /home/joe/my_own_vnc_parameters.rc:/home/headless/.vnc_override.rc
```

The content of the file should be similar to the provided example file `example-vnc-override.rc`:

```shell
### only lines beginning with 'export ' (at position 1) will be imported and sourced
;export VNC_COL_DEPTH=32
;export VNC_VIEW_ONLY=true
;export VNC_PW=secret
export VNC_RESOLUTION=1024x768
export DISPLAY=:2
export VNC_PORT=5902
export NOVNC_PORT=6902
;export NOVNC_HEARTBEAT=25
```

Please note that only the lines beginning with `export` at the first position will be imported.

By providing the variable values the following rules apply:

- The value of `ARG_VNC_DISPLAY/VNC_DISPLAY` should include also the leading colon (e.g. `:1`).
- The value of `ARG_VNC_PW/VNC_PW` can be empty. It effectively disables the VNC/noVNC password.

If you want to check, what parameter values have been actually applied, then you can start the container with the parameter `--debug`.

For example:

```shell
docker run -it -P --rm accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-g3:latest --debug

### output (excerpt)
VNC server started on display ':1' and TCP port '5901'
Connect via VNC viewer with 172.17.0.3:5901
noVNC started on TCP port '6901'
```

You should be aware, that overriding the VNC/noVNC parameters incorrectly could prevent the container from starting.

This feature assumes some preliminary knowledge and it is provided for advanced users that already know what they want to achieve.

For example, by default there is a relation between the `DISPLAY` and `VNC_PORT` values. Generally the convention `VNC_PORT = 5900 + DISPLAY` is followed (similarly `NOVNC_PORT = 6900 + DISPLAY`).

You may decide not to follow the conventions. This image allows you to set the parameters differently, but again, you should know, what you are doing.

Be also aware, that there are differences between the Linux and Windows environments.

If your session disconnects, it might be related to a network equipment (load-balancer, reverse proxy, ...) dropping the websocket session for inactivity (more info [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_read_timeout) and [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/websocket.html) for nginx). In such case, try defining the **NOVNC_HEARTBEAT=XX** environment variable at startup-time, where **XX** is the number of seconds between [websocket ping/pong](https://github.com/websockets/ws/issues/977) packets.

## Container user account

Containers created from this image run under the **application user** (by default `headless:headless`, `1000:1000`), which is a **non-root** user account. However, the application user gets permissions for `sudo`.

The **application user name** also defines the **home directory name**, which is by default `/home/headless`.

The default application user's password is `headless`, which is also the default `sudo` password.

The user's (and `sudo`) password can be changed inside the container by using the `passwd` command. For example, changing the password to `docker`:

```shell
echo 'headless:docker' | sudo chpasswd

### or also
sudo chpasswd <<<"headless:docker"
```

The `sudo` command allows user elevation, so the **application user** can install additional software inside the container.

The following example shows how to install **vim**:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y vim
```

### Overriding container user parameters

The user ID, user name, user group ID, user group name and the initial `sudo` password can be overridden during the build time (`docker build`).

The user ID and the group ID can be overridden also in run time (`docker run`).

#### Overriding user parameters in build-time

The build parameters `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_ID`, `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_NAME`, `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_ID` and `ARG_HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_NAME` are used during the build time (`docker build`) and they allow to override the related container parameters.

Their values are persisted in the corresponding environment variables `HEADLESS_USER_ID`, `HEADLESS_USER_NAME`, `HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_ID` and `HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_NAME`.

The build argument `ARG_SUDO_INITIAL_PW` allows overriding the initial application user's and `sudo` password (which is `headless`). This initial password is not stored into any environment variable, but into a temporary file, which is removed on the first container start. The password can be changed inside the container.

For example, building an image with the application user name `hairless`, with the primary user group `hairygroup`, the IDs `2002:3003` and the initial password `docker`:

```shell
docker build --build-arg ARG_HEADLESS_USER_NAME=hairless --build-arg ARG_HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_NAME=hairygroup --build-arg ARG_HEADLESS_USER_ID=2002 --build-arg ARG_HEADLESS_USER_GROUP_ID=3003 --build-arg ARG_SUDO_INITIAL_PW=docker ... -t my/image:overriden
```

#### Overriding user parameters in run-time

Both the user ID and group ID can be overridden also in the run time (`docker run`). It does not apply to the application user name, the group name and the initial password.

For example, this would override the `user:group` by `2000:3000`:

```shell
docker run --user 2000:3000 ... my/image:overriden
```

#### User permissions and ownership

The actual application user account and the user group are created by the startup script on the first container start.

During this one-time task the startup script needs to modify the container files `/etc/passwd` and `/etc/group`. That is why there is the line `chmod 666 /etc/passwd /etc/group` in the Dockerfile (see the `stage_final`). However, the permissions of these two files will be set to the standard value `644` just after creating the user.

The created user gets permissions for `sudo` and the ownership to the content of the home and startup folders.

The temporary file `~/.initial_sudo_password` is also deleted after creating the user.

There is the script `~/tests/test-01.sh` that allows quick check of the current permissions.

#### Other considerations

Please note that the described configuration will not be done if the startup script `startup.sh` will not be executed.

Also do not confuse the application user's password with the **VNC password**, because they both have the same default value (`headless`).

## Running containers in background (detached)

The following container will keep running in the background and it will listen on an automatically selected TCP port on the host computer:

```shell
docker run -d -P accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest
```

The following container will listen on the host's TCP port **25901**:

```shell
docker run -d -p 25901:5901 accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest
```

The following container will create (or re-use) the local named volume **my\_Downloads** mounted as `/home/headless/Downloads`:

```shell
docker run -d -P -v my_Downloads:/home/headless/Downloads accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest
```

or using the newer syntax with **--mount** flag:

```shell
docker run -d -P --mount source=my_Downloads,target=/home/headless/Downloads accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest
```

## Running containers in foreground (interactively)

The following container can be used interactively:

```shell
docker run -it --rm accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest bash
```

The opened `bash` session can be used as usual and then closed by entering `^C` (CTRL-C):

```shell
To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

headless@cf4a4e01d94b:~$ whoami
headless
headless@cf4a4e01d94b:~$ pwd
/home/headless
headless@cf4a4e01d94b:~$
```

The container will remove itself.

## Startup options and help

The image supports multiple **start-up options** and **start-up modifiers**. There also also two help modes.

The following container will print out the short help and then it will remove itself:

```shell
docker run --rm accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest --help
```

Example of the short help text:

```text
Container startup script
Usage: /dockerstartup/startup.sh [-v|--version] [-h|--help] [-H|--help-usage] [--(no-)wait] [--(no-)skip-startup] [--(no-)tail-null] [--(no-)tail-vnc] [--(no-)version-sticker] [--(no-)version-sticker-verbose] [--(no-)skip-vnc] [--(no-)skip-novnc] [--(no-)debug] [--(no-)verbose] [--] [<command-1>] ... [<command-n>] ...
        <command>: Optional command with optional arguments. It is executed during startup.
        -v, --version: Prints version
        -h, --help: Prints help
        -H, --help-usage: Extended container usage help.
        --wait, --no-wait: Default background execution mode (on by default)
        --skip-startup, --no-skip-startup: Default foreground execution mode (off by default)
        --tail-null, --no-tail-null: Alternative background execution mode (off by default)
        --tail-vnc, --no-tail-vnc: Alternative background execution mode (off by default)
        --version-sticker, --no-version-sticker: Alternative foreground execution mode (off by default)
        --version-sticker-verbose, --no-version-sticker-verbose: Alternative foreground execution mode (off by default)
        --skip-vnc, --no-skip-vnc: Startup process modifier (off by default)
        --skip-novnc, --no-skip-novnc: Startup process modifier (off by default)
        --debug, --no-debug: Startup process modifier (off by default)
        --verbose, --no-verbose: Startup process modifier (off by default)

Use '-H' or '--help-usage' for extended container usage help.

```

The following container will print out the long help and then it will remove itself:

```shell
docker run --rm accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3:latest --help-usage
```

Example of the long help text:

```text
CONTAINER USAGE:
docker run [<docker-run-options>] accetto/<image>:<tag> [<startup-options>] [<command>]

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS:
command
    Optional command with optional arguments.
    It will be executed during startup before going waiting, tailing or asleep.
    It is necessary to use the quotes correctly or the 'bash -c "<command>"' pattern.

STARTUP OPTIONS:

--wait, or no options, or unknown option, or empty input
    Default background execution mode.
    Starts the VNC and noVNC servers, if available, then executes the command
    and waits until the VNC server process exits or goes asleep infinitely.
    Container keeps running in the background.

--skip-startup
    Default foreground execution mode.
    Skips the startup procedure, executes the command and exits.
    Be aware that the container user generator will be also skipped.
    Container does not keep running in the background.

--tail-null
    Alternative background execution mode.
    Similar to '--wait', but tails the null device instead of going asleep.
    Container keeps running in the background.

--tail-vnc
    Alternative background execution mode.
    Similar to '--wait', but tails the VNC log instead of waiting until the VNC process exits.
    Falls back to '--tail-null' if the VNC server has not been started.
    Container keeps running in the background.

--version-sticker
    Alternative foreground execution mode.
    Prints out the version sticker info.
    The VNC server is also started by default, if available, because some applications
    need a display to report their versions correctly. It can be suppressed by providing
    also '--skip-vnc'. The '--skip-novnc' option is always enforced automatically.
    Container does not keep running in the background.

--version-sticker-verbose
    Alternative foreground execution mode.
    Similar to '--version-sticker', but prints out the verbose version sticker info and features list.
    Container does not keep running in the background.

--skip-vnc
    Startup process modifier.
    If VNC and noVNC startup should be skipped.
    It also enforces '--skip-novnc'.

--skip-novnc
    Startup process modifier.
    If noVNC startup should be skipped.
    It is also enforced by '--skip-vnc'.

--debug
    Startup process modifier.
    If additional debugging info should be displayed during startup.
    It also enforces option '--verbose'.

--verbose
    Startup process modifier.
    If startup progress messages should be displayed.
    It is also enforced by '--debug'.

--help-usage, -H
    Prints out this extended container usage help and exits.
    The rest of the input is ignored.

--help, -h
    Prints out the short startup script help and exits.
    The rest of the input is ignored.

--version, -v
    Prints out the version of the startup script and exits.
    The rest of the input is ignored.

Use '-h' or '--help' for short startup script help.
