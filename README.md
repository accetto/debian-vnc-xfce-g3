### Introduction

This GitHub repository contains resources and tools for building Docker images for headless working.

The images are based on the current [Debian 12][docker-debian] and the previous [Debian 11][docker-debian] and include [Xfce][xfce] desktop, [TigerVNC][tigervnc] server and [noVNC][novnc] client.
The popular web browsers [Chromium][chromium] and [Firefox][firefox] are also included.

This [User guide][this-user-guide] describes the images and how to use them.

The content of this GitHub project is intended for developers and image builders.

Ordinary users can simply use the images available in the following repositories on Docker Hub:

- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-docker-debian-vnc-xfce-g3]
- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-brave-g3][accetto-docker-debian-vnc-xfce-brave-g3]
- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3][accetto-docker-debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3]
- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3][accetto-docker-debian-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3]

This project has been derived from the sibling project [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3] containing similar images based on [Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and 20.04 LTS][docker-ubuntu].

### Building images

You can execute the individual hook scripts in the folder [/docker/hooks/][this-folder-docker-hooks].
However, the provided utilities are more convenient.

The script [builder.sh][this-readme-builder] builds individual images.
The script [ci-builder.sh][this-readme-ci-builder] can build various groups of images or all of them at once.

Before building the images you have to prepare and source the file `secrets.rc` (see [example-secrets.rc][this-example-secrets-file]).

Features that are enabled by default can be explicitly disabled via environment variables.
This allows building even smaller images by excluding the individual features (e.g. noVNC).

The resources for building the individual images and their variations (tags) are in the subfolders of the [/docker/][this-folder-docker] folder.

The individual README files contain quick examples of building the images:

- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-g3][this-readme-debian-vnc-xfce-g3]
- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-brave-g3][this-readme-debian-vnc-xfce-brave-g3]
- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3][this-readme-debian-vnc-xfce-chromium-g3]
- [accetto/debian-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3][this-readme-debian-vnc-xfce-firefox-g3]

Each image also has a separate README file intended for Docker Hub.
The final files should be generated by the utility [util-readme.sh][this-readme-util-readme-examples] and then copied to Docker Hub manually.

The following resources describe the image building subject in details:

- [readme-local-building-example.md][this-readme-local-building-example]
- [readme-builder.md][this-readme-builder]
- [readme-ci-builder.md][this-readme-ci-builder]
- [readme-g3-cache.md][this-readme-g3-cache]
- [readme-util-readme-examples.md][this-readme-util-readme-examples]
- [sibling Wiki][sibling-wiki]

### Image generations

This is the **third generation** (G3) of my headless images.
The **second generation** (G2) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/xubuntu-vnc-novnc][accetto-github-xubuntu-vnc-novnc].
The **first generation** (G1) contains the GitHub repository [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce].

### Project versions

This file describes the **eighths version** (G3v8) of the project.

This version brings some changes in the building pipeline and building utilities and it also fixes the problem with the badge service.

The service **Badgen.net**, which has been unusable for some time already, was replaced by the service [Shields.io][service-shields-io].

Consequently it was necessary to update all README files of all `accetto` repositories on **Docker Hub**. Therefore there are several new functions that support this kind of scenarios.

For example, now it's possible to update the `deployment gists` on the **GitHub** without re-build the images first. The updated hook script `post_push` can extract the badge values ad-hoc from the final deployment images available locally and it doesn't depend on the helper files created during the `pre_build` phase. It would use the images pulled from the **Docker Hub** as well.

This change makes it possible to refresh the gists using the "historical" data extracted from previously published images.

Gist updates are also more reliable because there will be up to 3 retries if an update fails.

The new functionality is available through the updated utility `ci-builder.sh`, which has got the following new commands:

- `list`
- `pull`
- `update-gists`
- `helper-help`

Please check the files `readme-ci-builder.md` and `readme-builder.md` for the description.

However, the project keeps evolving.
Please always check the [CHANGELOG][this-changelog] for the latest changes.

#### Previous versions

The previous versions are still available in this **GitHub** repository as the branches named as `archived-generation-g3v{d}`.

The version `G3v7` could build final images significantly faster, because the temporary helper images were used as external caches.

Internally, the helper image was built by the `pre_build` hook script and then used by the `build` hook script as an external cache.

The helper image was then removed by the `build` hook script and not the `pre_build` hook script as before, unless the `build` script will be skipped.

The main purpose of the version `G3v6` was to keep the project and the images uniform with the ones from the sibling `Ubuntu` projects.

The version `G3v5` has brought only one significant change comparing to the previous version `G3v1`.

- The updated script `set_user_permissions.sh`, which is part of Dockerfiles, skips the hidden files and directories now.
It generally should not have any unwanted side effects, but it may make a difference in some scenarios, hence the version increase.

*Remark*: The version numbers `G3v4`, `G3v3` and `G3v2` have been skipped, to align the numbering with the **sibling project** [accetto/ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3][accetto-github-ubuntu-vnc-xfce-g3].
